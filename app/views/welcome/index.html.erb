      <!-- Accra Ridge Church youth presents  Youth Camp  2014 dubbed  
      <span class="highlight"> “Come up hither” </span> based on the scriptures <span class="highlight">Rev 4:1b & Phil 3:14. </span> This year camp seeks to emphasize the fact that there is really no limit to this walk of faith. It is in fact a limitless (eternal) walk. Where ever one finds oneself there is always a greater glory to attain. Are you unsaved? Get saved. Are you redeemed? Work out your salvation. Are you working? Manifest that glory. For The Lord seeks purified vessels of honor through whom He can establish His perfect plans He has for the church, the academy, and the work place. Youth Camp 2014! come lets seek more from our Father.

God has poured His love on us and we need to respond to Him. <span class="highlight">“The Call” </span>simply speaks on the premise that God has called us with a holy calling in Christ Jesus. We are a special people/Holy nation <span class="highlight">(2Tim, 1:9-10)</span> 
There's <span class="highlight">"The Cost"</span> that comes with it that’s why the walk of Faith cannot be limited to the receiving of forgiveness of sins or receiving of gifts only, but in addition it must affect all spheres of our lives. I.e marriage, relationships, career etc. Then “The Commission” becomes more of a reality than just a duty. <%= link_to "....read more", :purpose %>

God began changing my life from my very first camp in 2010 and I have never missed camp since. It’s just a totally awesome experience. Right after my first camp, I learnt to change my way of thinking which previously included notions like;

"Of course I'm a Christian, I go to church all the time"
"Of course I'm a Christian, my parents are"
"Of course I'm a Christian, I grew up in the church"

I learnt to actually have a personal relationship with God. Every day of every camp, I learnt something new. I started growing, becoming stronger in my faith. The most beautiful part of it is that you are not alone. You fellowship with people who are very much like you and are going through the same things as you. At camp, I met wonderful people and built some of my most lasting friendships with Christian brothers and sisters. 

We all become like a big family at camp. Camp really lifted my burdens. I never left camp with my problems no matter how sad, frustrated or even depressed I thought I was. Camp really has changed my life a 100% through that very real encounter I had with Jesus and now I continue to walk with Jesus not just as the God everyone knows but as my best friend.  We talk everyday about everything.

        Camp has helped me in many ways but most of all it has helped show me who God really is and how he works in us.
Before camp I used to think prayer was just something we needed to do just before you ate or went to bed but at camp I learnt it was a way of communicating with our father and that He’s always listening to our prayers regardless of what it is.
 ..
Camp also helped me overcome a lot of social issues and gave me new friends who are still impacting my life today.
